## What is a Board?

Agile Boards in OpenProject support teams in their agile project management methodology, e.g. Scrum or Kanban.

You can create as many flexible boards as you want with both lists and cards on it. A list usually represents a workflow, e.g. status or versions of a work package. The cards are work packages, e.g. tasks, on this list.
