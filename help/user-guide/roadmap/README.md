# Product roadmap release planning

Plan and manage your product roadmap in OpenProject. Visualize, and communicate your product roadmap. Share your product roadmap with your stakeholders, get feedback about your ideas and break it down into a detailed release plan.

In the roadmap, you can see all work packages and their status listed by versions at a glance.

For each version, the related work package can be assessed from the list displayed in the roadmap view. Subjects which are crossed out represent closed work packages.

This view also provides information on the **projectâ€™s progress** for each version by displaying the percentage of closed vs. open work packages and the **total progress**.

Clicking the title of a version allows you to evaluate further information of this version.
